dirty sport programming python to cpp code converter

As we all know, python is terribly slow for solving codeforces tasks. An i'm TIRED of rewriting in cpp every single time so i thought i can do something about that...

It's only for SPORT programming and yet support only a few things but at least somehow works

yet it only support

'print' (cout) with end='whatever'

'if' with multiple commands per condition

'else' 

'for whatever in range' with multiple commands per condition

range(x), range(x,y) and range(x,y,z)

input (for string)

int(input() (for int) # all int's are yet long longs

int vars (still long longs) like a = 5 or b=1704



todo: maybe 'elif'   arrays    var string    split()    a,b = b,a?    random    for i in [arr]


#TESTS

i made some tests to make it easier to detect any errors. those do just execute python code and write results to answers2, then translate python to cpp, compile and run writing to answers1. then you can manually compare files yourself, use diff, or read files and compare them in python as strings. i do it b4 make any changes so i can be sure i broke nothing
