sport programming python to cpp code converter

As we all know, python is terribly slow for solving codeforces tasks. An i'm TIRED of rewriting in cpp every single time so i thought i can do something about that...

It's only for SPORT programming and yet support only a few things but at least somehow works

yet it only support
'print' (cout) with end='whatever'
'if' with multiple commands per condition
'for whatever in range' with multiple commands per condition
range(x), range(x,y) and range(x,y,z)

todo:
'else' and maybe 'elif'
variables
arrays
